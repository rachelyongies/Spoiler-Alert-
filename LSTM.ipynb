left five people dead  conlon s father guiseppe was subsequently imprisoned along with six other conlon relatives who became known as the maguire seven                                      the story opens with a flash forward to the bombing of a pub in the guildford suburb of london  the pub  frequented by british soldiers  was targeted by the irish republican army  ira  as an act of terrorism a woman driving a car listens to a cassette recording of gerry conlon  a northern irish political prisoner  gerry speaks of his younger years living in belfast where he had steal lead sheets from the roofs of row houses and sell them  one day  while holding a piece of piping  he is shot at by british soldiers who mistake him for a sniper  believing the pipe is a rifle  gerry runs into the streets and through several homes while being chased  he inadvertently starts a small riot and joins the mob throwing rocks and molotov cocktails  members of the ira  who d been using one of the houses gerry runs through as a munitions cache  find gerry and threaten to shoot him in the leg  gerry s father  giuseppe  told by his daughters that their brother is in trouble  rushes to the scene and talks to the ira leader  who tells giuseppe that they are just trying to scare gerry into behaving  giuseppe decides to send gerry by boat to london in the hopes that he will find work and avoid the troubles in belfast on the boat to london  gerry meets his friend paul hill  the two arrive in london and go immediately to a squatter s house where their friend patrick armstrong lives with a small group of hippies  gerry and paul also visit the home of his aunt  annie maguire  gerry and paul seem to enjoy their time in london until one day one of patrick s british friends  jim  acts hostile toward them and they decide to leave the squat  they wander through london  finally settling on a bench in a park where they are accosted by a homeless man  charlie burke   who is carved his initials into the bench  charlie is irish and they talk for a time  paul and gerry continue to walk through london until they pass the house of a prostitute  she refuses to talk to them when they try to return the wallet she drops  gerry walks into her unlocked apartment and finds a stash of money in her bedroom  gerry takes the money and the two spend the night in a hotel in guilford  the bomb goes off in the soldier s pub  killing five people  four of whom are in the military  the british police begin to hunt for suspects  not long before  legislation  the prevention of terrorism act  is passed in parliament that allows the british police to hold potential suspects for seven days before they are formally charged gerry returns to belfast and rejoins his family  in london  jim  who d been hostile to gerry and paul talks to the police and identifies the two as troublemakers  paul  who d remained in london  is arrested and gerry recognizes him on tv by his shoes  a few days later the brits invade the conlon home and arrest gerry  taking him back to london  gerry is held without formal charges and is tortured and interrogated  being kept awake for seven days straight  he is beaten severely and forced to look at the forensic photos of the victims  his interrogators also tell him that his aunt annie is being charged as well with bombmaking  operating out of her home  eventually  paul is brought to gerry  having confessed himself  and he tells gerry to do the same  gerry still refuses to cooperate until one of the policemen threatens to kill his father  gerry relents and signs his name to a false statement of confession to the bombings gerry and paul  paddy armstrong and their friend carole richardson  known collectively as the guildford four  are charged with the bombings  while in a processing facility awaiting trial  gerry s father is also brought in  accused of being part of the bombmaking conspiracy involving annie maguire  giuseppe talks to gerry  who feels that his rough relationship with his father turned him to thievery and that he was destined to get into trouble like this  gerry has a minor  brief breakdown but his father is able to calm him the trial begins under heavy security  the prosecution contends that gerry  paul  patrick and carole committed the bombings  however solid evidence is lacking and they only have the confessions made by the accused  which the police commissioner  dickson  claims were not obtained under duress  annie maguire and her family are accused of bombmaking  a group that includes her youngest son  who was also beaten into confessing  on the witness stand  gerry admits that he robbed the hooker s home and that he and paul met charlie burke in the park  the prosecution claims no knowledge of burke s existence the trial ends with the guilford four being found guilty  all are given lengthy sentences  gerry s is a minimum of   years  the judge makes a point of stating that he had give gerry the death penalty for treason if gerry had been so accused  giuseppe is also sentenced to   years for smuggling explosives to annie maguire  gerry himself develops an intense hatred for lawyers in voiceover we hear gerry speaking on the tapes that he is made up for an attorney named gareth peirce  she goes to the park where paul and gerry met charlie burke and even finds his name carved into the bench giuseppe and gerry are sent to park royal  a maximum security prison  barker  the prison s warder  makes gerry and his father wear blue outfits with yellow stripes  branding them as the worst criminal population  the prison is mostly inhabited by english convicts and any irish prisoners are ostracized and persecuted  gerry falls in with a small group of jamaicans who have a large supply of lsd disguised as a jigsaw puzzle  gerry spends time getting stoned with them but his father disapproves  gerry promises to stay off the drugs  even after giuseppe dies gerry meets another irish convict named joe mcandrews  joe reveals that he and his people were responsible for the guilford pub bombings and for smuggling the explosives used in the attack  mcandrews informs the police that they are holding innocent people for the crime but british police still refuse to let them out  mcandrews is shunned and persecuted like every other irish prisoner  even starting a fight with the minions of a hulking brit named ronnie smalls  mcandrews threatens to kill smalls  family since he knows their address  smalls backs off  mcandrews and gerry also stage a protest to call attention to the conlons  innocence  seizing control of the cellblock for a brief period until barker sends in a riot squad to retake the prison by violent force  after the seizure is quelled  during a screening of the godfather for the prison population  mcandrews sprays barker with lighter fluid and sets him aflame  gerry  shocked by the horror of mcandrews  violent methods  separates himself from his fellow countryman  mcandrews is remanded to a different prison gareth peirce becomes the conlons  attorney through gerry s mother s influence  gerry instantly dislikes gareth but is gradually convinced she means to help him and his father  a campaign to prove the innocence of the conlons and the guildford four and the maguire seven begins to gain popularity  giuseppe  despite increasingly debilitating respiratory problems  manages some of the campaign from his and gerry s cell  after the burning of barker  gerry tells his father he will help with the campaign  peirce gives gerry a tape recorder and tells him to recount every detail of his life one night gerry notices his father has stopped breathing  he is able to revive giuseppe long enough to have him transported out of the prison for medical care  however  gerry is not permitted to accompany his father  a priest later visits gerry to tell him that his father died gerry continues to meet with peirce  developing a tremendous amount of trust for her  he continues giuseppe s campaign work in earnest  the british government tries to transfer him to a scottish prison to prevent him from working the campaign and meeting with peirce but the effort fails peirce reviews the judiciary files of the conlons court case  she is only allowed to view giuseppe s files on the orders of dickson  one day she visits the court archives and inadvertently passes a nasty cold on to the court clerk  a few days later she visits the archives again and finds a man substituting for the clerk  the man behind the counter asks peirce if she wants the files for either giuseppe or gerry conlon  peirce seizes the opportunity to view gerry s files and finds a folder containing the statement made by charlie burke that could vindicate gerry himself  attached to the statement is a handwritten note from dickson himself that reads  not to be shown to the defence   peirce steals the file and begins to build a new case and trial for gerry and the members of the guilford four the four are brought back to london  gareth leads their defense and  following an impassioned recounting of the sentences handed down to the four and annie maguire s family  presents charlie burke s statement to the court  she accuses dickson openly of destroying the lives of the defendants and of their complicity in the death of giuseppe conlon  the judge calls for order and reviews the evidence and declares that the four are innocent and free to go  however  the judge refuses to charge dickson or his accomplices with any misconduct and also does not declare the late giuseppe innocent  gerry and paul refuse to be escorted from the building by the bailiffs  gerry  standing with his family  makes a statement to the media in front of the court building saying he will carry on the campaign to clear his father s name \n"
